# Website Performance Optimization Summary

## Initial State
- Initial Lighthouse Performance Score: 35%
- Major Issues:
  - Main Thread Work: 7.2s (JavaScript parsing, style calculations)
  - Largest Contentful Paint: 7,480ms
  - Render-blocking resources
  - Unused JavaScript
  - Images not in next-gen formats

## First Optimization Attempt
- Added Vite plugins:
  - vite-plugin-compression
  - vite-plugin-imagemin
- Implemented code splitting:
  - Vendor chunk
  - Animations chunk
  - Email functionality chunk
- Added image optimization settings:
  - Quality: 85%
  - WebP support
- Added gzip compression
- Result: Performance score decreased to 29%

## Second Approach
- Simplified Vite configuration
- Removed complex plugins
- Maintained basic code splitting
- Identified main bottleneck: unoptimized Pexels images

## Final Solution
- Optimized Pexels image URLs with query parameters:
  - Portfolio images: `?auto=compress&w=800&q=80`
  - Hero images: `?auto=compress&w=1920&q=80`
  - SEO/meta images: `?auto=compress&w=1200&q=80`
- Result: Performance score improved to 51%

## Next Steps
- Further optimizations to be implemented after hosting
- Current score (51%) provides a reasonable baseline for initial deployment
- Post-hosting optimizations may include:
  - CDN implementation
  - Server-side caching
  - Additional image optimizations
  - Code minification refinements
